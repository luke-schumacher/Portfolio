                <p><strong>Technical Architecture:</strong> Implemented CVAE (Conditional Variational Autoencoder)
                    generating synthetic customer profiles for healthcare technology sales. PyTorch-based model with
                    dual encoders capturing 47 features (demographics + behavioral metrics), 128-dimensional latent
                    space, <200ms inference targeting production deployment on AWS EC2.</p>

                        <p><strong>Core Challenge:</strong> Operated under GDPR/HIPAA compliance while handling severely
                            imbalanced customer segments. Required real-time predictions with full interpretability for
                            non-technical stakeholders—critical constraints for healthcare production systems.</p>

                        <p><strong>Solutions & Trade-offs:</strong> Applied SMOTE oversampling in latent space (not
                            input space) to preserve feature correlations. Added attention mechanism to decoder for
                            feature importance scoring—15% inference slowdown but essential for stakeholder buy-in.
                            Quantized model to INT8 via TensorRT achieving 3x speedup with <2% accuracy loss.</p>

                                <p><strong>Team & Impact:</strong> Led ML engineering on 4-person team plus 2 domain
                                    experts. Designed architecture, implemented training pipeline, optimized for
                                    deployment. Iterative latent space analysis revealed customer clusters invisible in
                                    raw data—directly informed strategy.</p>

                                <p><strong>Defense/Aerospace Relevance:</strong> Experience with compliance

            <div class="space-y-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                <p><strong>System Architecture:</strong> Distributed multi-agent system combining RAG
                    (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) with Neo4j knowledge graphs for autonomous infrastructure fault
                    diagnosis. Three specialized agents—Governance (Telekom policies), Hardware (Siemens equipment
                    manuals), Telemetry (Illigo event logs)—coordinate through message queue (RabbitMQ) orchestrated by
                    FastAPI microservices. RAG pipeline uses ChromaDB + GPT-4 for grounded reasoning.</p>

                <p><strong>Technical Challenges:</strong> Integrated heterogeneous data sources (PDFs, CSV, JSON) with
                    different update frequencies. Agent coordination critical—preventing conflicting diagnoses while
                    maintaining autonomy. System must scale to 10,000+ devices with real-time telemetry. No ground-truth
                    labels for multi-domain faults complicated evaluation.</p>

                <p><strong>Solutions:</strong> Built unified entity resolution layer with custom parsers (added 200ms
                    latency but ensured consistency). Implemented Dempster-Shafer voting mechanism where agents propose
                    diagnoses with confidence scores—coordinator aggregates probabilistically. Introduced "Mean Time to
                    Innocence" (MTTI) metric—time to correctly identify fault is NOT in given domain, validated with
                    SMEs.</p>

                <p><strong>Key Learning:</strong> RAG retrieval quality is bottleneck—invested 40% of effort optimizing
                    chunking strategy and embeddings. Agent specialization proved more effective than monolithic models
                    for complex distributed systems.</p>

                <p><strong>Defense Applicability:</strong> Multi-agent architecture directly maps to C4ISR systems
                    requiring distributed decision-making under uncertainty. Experience with heterogeneous data fusion
                    and autonomous coordination relevant to military operations and logistics optimization.</p>

                    mechanics. Vanilla JavaScript + HTML5 Canvas frontend integrated with Groq SDK (Llama-3.1-70B). Five
                    distinct character agents with specialized system prompts and personalities. Client-side state
                    management with localStorage persistence, deployed on Netlify with edge functions for secure API key
                    management.</p>

                <p><strong>Core Challenges:</strong> Defending against prompt injection—players attempting to
                    "jailbreak" agents and reveal system prompts. LLM non-determinism made progression unpredictable.
                    API latency (2-3 seconds) disrupted game flow. Budget constraint of $50/month for educational
                    deployment serving 200+ users.</p>

                <p><strong>Robustness Design:</strong> Implemented multi-layer prompt defense: system prompt
                    reinforcement, meta-prompting for jailbreak detection, and fallback responses. Added lightweight
                    response classifier validating agent outputs before display—retry on failures reduced variance by
                    60%. Trade-off: slightly reduced spontaneity but dramatically improved reliability.</p>

                <p><strong>Cost Optimization:</strong> Response caching for common interactions plus rate limiting kept
                    deployment under budget while maintaining responsiveness.</p>

                <p><strong>learnings & Defense Relevance:</strong> Concise, directive prompts outperformed verbose
                    ones—clarity beats length. User testing revealed creative exploits highlighting importance of
                    adversarial thinking in AI system design. Experience hardening LLM agents against malicious inputs
                    applicable to secure chatbots and AI assistants in sensitive environments. System prompt engineering

                        <p><strong>Data & Performance Constraints:</strong> Missing data during maintenance windows with
                            irregular sampling created data quality issues. Multi-scale temporal patterns (hourly,
                            daily, weekly cycles) required careful architecture design. Production threshold: >85%
                            accuracy to impact operations; real-time scheduling decisions demanded <50ms latency.</p>

                                <p><strong>Solutions:</strong> Implemented time-series specific imputation—linear
                                    interpolation for short gaps, seasonal decomposition for long gaps preserved

                    dashboard with NetworkX relationship mapping. Built in 48-hour hackathon achieving dual awards.</p>

                <p><strong>Scale & Noise Challenges:</strong> Processing 50,000+ articles daily within tight timeline.
                    High noise from irrelevant mentions and entity extraction false positives. Generic sentiment models
                    performed poorly on domain-specific ESG language ("greenwashing," "emissions"). Dashboard required
